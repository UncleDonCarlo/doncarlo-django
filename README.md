Django REST API Project


This is a Django-based RESTful API backend designed to provide project management features through a clean API interface. The project uses Django REST Framework (DRF) for API endpoints, JSON Web Token (JWT) for authentication, and drf-spectacular for auto-generated API documentation with Swagger and ReDoc.
